# STOCKHOLMTOURGUIDE
This app uses viewpager, recyclerview with cardview, 
recycler.adapter that takes in cursor, FragmentStatePagerAdapter that takes in cursor,
CursorLoader,CustomSQLiteOpenHelper which reads data from a ready-built SQLite Database.
It also designs a custom translucent background for detail activity to make it look like floating on Main_activity

The things I can add in the future:
1)in the city fragment, I can add live time, weather forecast
2)I can find traveling api to retrieve data through http request and json
3)I can add custom setting preference
4)Add a splash screen in app launch
